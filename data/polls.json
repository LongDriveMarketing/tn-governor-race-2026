  "analysis": "Three Beacon Center/TennSight polls now paint a clearer picture of the Republican primary. Blackburn's lead has narrowed from 68% (August 2025) to 56% (January 2026) — still commanding, but a 12-point drop over five months. The most striking detail: Rose hasn't gained despite spending millions on TV ads. He's actually dropped from 14% to 9%. The movement has gone to Fritts (3% → 7%) and the undecided column (14% → 28%). That growing undecided pool — over a quarter of Republican voters — is the real battleground. It suggests voter uncertainty rather than a locked-in race. The next Beacon poll (likely April 2026) will be critical: if Rose's ad blitz hasn't moved his numbers by then, the primary may effectively be over. Education policy is a potential differentiator — 72% of Tennesseans support the federal school choice tax credit, and 67% backed Lee's voucher expansion, creating pressure on all candidates to stake out strong positions.",
