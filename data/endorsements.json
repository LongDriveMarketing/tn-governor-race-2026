  "analysis": {
    "blackburn": "Blackburn's endorsement coalition is historically dominant for a Republican primary. She has locked up nearly the entire TN congressional delegation, both legislative chamber leaders, 30+ state legislators, and major conservative organizations including Club for Growth PAC. Rose has not secured a single endorsement from an elected official. With Trump publicly praising Blackburn in January 2026, the institutional picture is overwhelmingly one-sided.",
    "rose": "Rose has zero endorsements from elected officials — a striking gap for a sitting congressman. Despite raising $5.5M+ through aggressive early TV advertising, his inability to win over any party leaders forces him into a pure outsider-vs-establishment dynamic. His strategy appears to bypass the endorsement game entirely and go directly to voters through advertising and his Tennessee donor base messaging.",
    "green": "The Democratic endorsement picture reflects the party's diminished statewide infrastructure in Tennessee. Green has the backing of Moms Demand Action and Rep. Steve Cohen, Tennessee's only Democratic congressman. The real question is whether national Democratic organizations or prominent Tennessee Democrats like Phil Bredesen weigh in before the primary."
