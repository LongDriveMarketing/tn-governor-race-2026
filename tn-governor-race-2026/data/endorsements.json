  "analysis": {
    "blackburn": "Blackburn's endorsement haul is historically dominant for a Republican primary this early. She has locked up the entire TN congressional delegation (except Rose himself and Fleischmann), both legislative chamber leaders, and 30+ state legislators. This institutional support makes it extremely difficult for Rose or Fritts to build a viable coalition within the party.",
    "rose": "Rose's thin endorsement portfolio is his biggest structural weakness. Despite a $6.46M war chest and early TV ads, his inability to win over party leaders forces him into an outsider-vs-establishment dynamic. His strategy appears to be bypassing the endorsement game entirely and going directly to voters through advertising.",
    "green": "The Democratic endorsement picture is sparse across the board, reflecting the party's diminished statewide infrastructure in Tennessee. Green's Moms Demand Action support is meaningful but narrow. The real question is whether national Democratic organizations or prominent Tennessee Democrats like Jim Cooper or Phil Bredesen weigh in before the primary."
